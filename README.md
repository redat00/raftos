# raftos-plus

This project is a fork of the original raftos that is unfortunately not maintained anymore. As the old version was not compatible with Python > 3.10 and upper, I decided to fork it, and make it work. You can find the original, and excellent, work here : [Original repository](https://github.com/zhebrak/raftos)

At this stage it's still a WIP, and I'm actively working on improving it over the old project : 
- Making it compatible with Python version up to 3.11 ;
- Improving the way nodes can connect (with mTLS support) ;
- Cleaning up the code to make it PEP8 compliant, and more readable ;

All this work is pretty big, as Raft is not an easy solution to put in place, so if you want to contribute, you're free to do so !
